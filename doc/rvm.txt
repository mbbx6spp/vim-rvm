INTRODUCTION                                    *rvm*

Install in ${HOME}/.vim on *NIX, or in ${HOME}\vimfiles if you're on Windows.
Vim 7.2 is recommended as it ships with syntax highlighting for many Git file
types.

COMMANDS                                        *rvm-commands*

These commands are local to the buffers in which they work (buffers that are 
part of an RVM project or Ruby files).

:Rvm [args]             Run an arbitrary RVM command. Similar to :!rvm [args]

:RvmList                Bring up the output of |:!rvm list| in the preview
                        window.  Press I to |:RvmInstall| the Ruby version on 
                        the cursor line (this may take some time).  

MAPPINGS                                        *rvm-mappings*

STATUSLINE                                      *rvm-statusline*

                                                *rvm#statusline()*
Add %{rvm#statusline()} to your statusline to get an indicator of the Ruby

file exists for the project.
